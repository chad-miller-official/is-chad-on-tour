  DEVELOPMENTAL NOTE Cycle II: Literacy Skills
  <br />
  Child's name: Chad Miller &nbsp; Date: MARCH, 1999
</h2>

<p>
  As an "older preschooler" reading and writing have become a part of Chad's
  everyday experience. He has had the opportunity to explore the materials at the
  literacy table. By looking at books and having stories read to him, Chad has learned the
  importance of reading and writing as a form of communication. Group charting and
  story dictations provide an opportunity for him to share his unique ideas with others.
  This Developmental Note will illustrate how Chad's literacy skills have grown the past
  year. The information in italics indicates skills from last year followed by the new skills.

      <i>
        Last year, when presented with the written alphabet in random order, Chad
        recognized all of the upper and lower case letters. He recognized his written
        name as well as those of his classmates and teachers.
      </i>
      This year Chad can identify words in his environment. He can read short stories, signs and
      countries off the globe.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Last year, Chad was beginning to write the names of his classmates.</i>
      This year, Chad can write his own name and the names of his classmates,
      teachers and family members. He uses inventive spelling while at the literacy
      table. He will create danger signs, maps and books. Recently, Chad used
      inventive spelling to write "solar system" he wrote it as "solr stm" on a book
      he was making. The focus of the inventive spelling is the process of applying a
      letter to a sound, rather than the "correct" spelling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chad continues to have a great interest in books. He listens attentively at
      group story time. He asks to see encyclopedias and magazines from my
      office and will request specific library books. Chad will copy words and titles
      from books.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chad participates in story dictations while at the literacy table. He will dictate
      stories about trains, countries and most recently, the solar system. He
      contributes ideas during group literacy activities (i.e. What do police officers
      do? "If people are fighting, they help").
    </li>
    <li>
      He is able to answer simple questions about the stories we read and is also
      able to recall many stories in sequence.
