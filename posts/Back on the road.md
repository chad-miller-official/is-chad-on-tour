# Back on the road

## August 5th, 2025

Often the question is asked, "is Chad on tour?" The answer, as of today, is yes: I am on tour, and I will be back on August 24th (technically August 23rd, as Michael Cera Palin's last show of tour is in Atlanta). I registered ischadontour.com for the express purpose of answering this question, although it's since become a blog.

Unlike the previous tour diary I kept for MCP's west coast tour, I do not plan to extensively document this tour this time around, nor do I plan to describe the shows or logistics of touring in great detail.  Rather, I'll be writing about whatever I do or think of *outside* of the van and venue - both literally and figuratively - which may or may not be directly influenced by the tour schedule and regimen. That said, I am looking forward to touring the Midwest and East Coast again, back in familiar territory I've toured countless times since 2014.

I've been making more of a concerted effort to read this year. One of the books I've been reading is a graphic novel called *Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth* by Chris Ware. I picked up a copy in New Orleans in January, right before MCP's first show of the year, when I was in a weird headspace. In the month or so beforehand, for no clear reason, I became horribly depressed.  Nothing in particular had changed about my life. I still had my house, I still had all my friends, I still had my job at Sevananda, I was still actively contributing to the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute, and I still had my band. All my parts still worked as they should and I wasn't hurting for money or food. I now recognize my several-months-long depressive episode earlier this year to be the human body's response to the final phase of an astrological cycle that, over the course of over two years, upturned my life and brought about great personal confusion, before evaporating into the cosmic ether and leaving behind solid crystals of newfound clarity and focus.

When I picked *Jimmy Corrigan* up and flipped through a few sections, two things immediately stood out:

1. The titular character is also a depressed-looking guy in his 30s, and

2. The skyline in the background of several scenes is clearly Chicago, John Hancock Center and Sears Tower poking out of the skyline silhouette and all.

I took this as a sign that I should buy the book, although I didn't get around to reading it until just a few days ago. The drab color palette, sparse text, and gratuitous fragments of surreality injected throughout an otherwise realistic fiction hinted that the best time to read the book is when I'm alone at home, and feeling generally uncomfortable with being alone at home. The last few days have been the ideal time to finally start reading it: not only have they been gray and rainy, but they've also been the last few days I have at home before leaving for tour again, the short span of time when the purely intellectual knowledge of impending leaving morphs into an all-encompassing psycho-emotional sensation. It's the uncomfortable acid come-up of tour, and I can never move past it quickly enough.

I'm only a few chapters(?) in, but so far I've assessed that  *Jimmy Corrigan*'s pacing is deliberately slow. It's the type of story that isn't so much driven by plot or character or even world development, but rather by immersion in Jimmy's environment. The streets and buildings are near-monochrome, painted with drab browns, greys, and ochre, reflecting a sort of passiveness in Jimmy's character in regards to his own chronic ennui. It's strangely comforting; perhaps I see Jimmy as my own path not taken, the one that could have led me deeper into isolation after one bad summer spent brooding in an apartment in northwest Indianapolis when I was 19.

I've also started reading Tim Kineslla's *All Over and Over*, a tour diary from 2006 documenting a Make Believe tour that I picked up at Cap'n Jazz's merch stand when they played the EARL last week. It's been hard to put it down, but I'm trying to make it last until the end of this tour. Reading Tim's thoughts on the road and how closely they mirror my own provides great comfort when the ground is constantly moving underneath you, never spending more than 16 hours in the same city, meeting friends you haven't seen in 18 months and making friends who you won't see again for 18 months.

Tim's writing style also makes me realize that I'm not particularly articulate with my thoughts, my vocabulary is comparatively limited, and I'm not very well-read. I suspect that years upon years of social media use and being fed algorithmically-curated slop has done a number on my intellect. My goal for the rest of this year and for the rest of my life is to retreat into more intellectal pursuits in my downtime, rather than scroll through garbage on Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.

I was suggested by my friend Maxime, who lives in France and studied in Atlanta for a year back in 2022 or 2023, that I should make an RSS feed for this website. After I finish writing and uploading this post, I'm going to get to work on that. I'm not sure if RSS feeds are widely used anymore, but I've gotten requests to make an RSS feed for the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute website, so either way it wouldn't hurt to learn and write one for this website. When it's done I'll write a new post about it here.

Cheers,

\- Chad
